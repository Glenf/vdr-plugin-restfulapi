CURRENTLY WORKING ON:
implement creating timers (with params in html body from f.e. html form)
find a better way to get the duration (maybe patch videodir.* from vdr)

OTHER MUST HAVE'S:
implement unique-ids if they will be in vdr 1.7.19
add hosts.conf and make paths configurable (sqlite?)

NICE TO HAVE:
support for epgsearch-plugin
add remote.json to control vdr
